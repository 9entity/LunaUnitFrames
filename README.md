Unit Frames for WoW Classic

FOR THE 1.12.1 VERSION SELECT IT FROM THE BRANCH MENU

THIS IS VERY EARLY ALPHA STAGE! NOT REALLY USABLE FOR GAMEPLAY!
Since addons were disabled in the Blizzcon preview and there is no alpha/beta this is somewhat speculative.
However the UI code of the preview client is available: https://github.com/Daribon/wow-ui-source/tree/classic
So this will serve as a base for LunaUnitFrames 3. Currently this can be tested in the BFA client.

Feel free to fork this but give credit (at least author & link to this github)
