# LunaUnitFrames
Unit Frames for WoW Classic

FOR THE 1.12.1 VERSION SELECT IT FROM THE BRANCH MENU

THIS IS VERY EARLY ALPHA STAGE! NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK ON CLASSIC BETA!
So this will serve as a base for LunaUnitFrames 3. Currently this can be tested in the BFA client.
Since i do not have access to the beta at this time i can't say if this actually works.

List of stuff that is still missing:
- Fix tags, add description
- Mana / Energy ticker
- Squares
- Totems
- Inc heal
- Font options
- Bar Textures
- Reset profile
- Vertical bars
- Fix reckoning stacks

Feel free to fork this but give credit (at least author & link to this github)

DO NOT REUPLOAD! LINK HERE INSTEAD.
