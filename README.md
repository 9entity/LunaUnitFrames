THIS IS VERY EARLY ALPHA STAGE! THE FOLLOWING THINGS ARE BROKEN ON CLASSIC BETA!
This will serve as a base for LunaUnitFrames 3.

List of stuff that is still missing:
- Fix heal based tags, add description
- Mana / Energy ticker
- Squares
- Totems
- Non player castbars
- Drag placement in config mode broken
- XP bar tags
- Inc heal
- Reset profile
- Vertical bars
- Fix reckoning stacks
- Party frames are broken due to broken blizzard code (Maybe i can do a workaround?)
- Target (ToT, ToToT) right click menu is broken (Maybe i can do a workaround?)

Feel free to fork this but give credit (at least author & link to this github)
